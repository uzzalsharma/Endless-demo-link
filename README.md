This project proposes a **Wallet & Browser UX Enhancement** for the Endless ecosystem.  
The goal is to simplify wallet interactions, reduce user confusion, and improve overall usability for both new and existing users on Endless.

Problem Statement
Many users entering the Endless ecosystem—especially non-technical and Web2 users—face difficulties understanding wallet actions such as transaction signing, gas fees, network switching, and token management.

- Clear transaction explanations before signing  
- Simplified gas fee and balance display  
- Step-by-step guided actions for new users  
- Better visual hierarchy for tokens, NFTs, and activity  
- User-friendly warnings and confirmations  

The focus is on reducing cognitive load while maintaining security and transparency.

Key Features
- Beginner-friendly transaction confirmation screen  
- Improved token & NFT visibility  
- Smart hints and tooltips for first-time users  
- Cleaner navigation and responsive layout  
- Seamless browser–wallet interaction

Benefits to the Endless Ecosystem
